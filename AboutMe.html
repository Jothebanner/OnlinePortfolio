  <p>I first got into software development in scouts, when we decided to get the robotics merit badge. We never actually got the badge but it peaked my interest in software when we learned to program Arduino boards.</p>
  <p>During high school I spent my summers going to the DATC, taking the Software Development course. In school I've been able to work on several significant projects for HTML & CSS, Java, and C#.

  <p>In my professional life, I try to utilize my knowledge when I can. I've built tools to help with work and can better understand error messages, which is especially useful when working as a tech support agent at H&R Block.</p>
  <p>I am passionate about software development and am looking for a position where I can develop functional software full time.</p>
